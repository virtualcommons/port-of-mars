        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>
          You are 1 of 5 residents at the Port of Mars, the first long-term
          habitat on the planet. Each game consists of 8 â€”12 rounds, each with
          phases of investing, trading, purchasing, discarding, and reacting to
          Mars events. Chance and player actions impact system health. If system
          health falls to zero all players die.

          <h3>The Objective</h3>
          <p>
            Your mission is to stay alive and achieve the most victory points.
            Each round you receive 10 time blocks that you can invest in system
            health or accomplishments. System health will maintain the shared
            infrastructure (upkeep) and keep the team alive. Accomplishments
            will earn you victory points.
