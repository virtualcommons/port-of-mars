            <h3>The Game</h3>
            <p>
              You are 1 of 5 residents at the Port of Mars, the first long-term habitat on the
              planet. Each game consists of 8—12 rounds, each with phases of investing, trading,
              purchasing, discarding, and reacting to Mars events. Chance and player actions impact
              system health. If system health falls to zero all players die.

            <h3>The Objective</h3>
            <p>
              Your mission is to stay alive and achieve the most victory points. Each round you
              receive 10 time blocks that you can invest in system health or accomplishments. System
              health will maintain the shared infrastructure (upkeep) and keep the team alive.
              Accomplishments will earn you victory points.
